This project is a demonstration of I/O expansion of XMOS XS1 devices using shift registers.

A main application note (titled "Shift Register Expansion Of XMOS XS1 Devices") has been written.

For the application note several boards were designed to demonstrate the theory, one for the XK-1 and one for the XR-USB-AUDIO-2.0-MC.

The files are as follows:

- shift_registers.pdf - main application note.

- provolone_hw - contains the schematic, BOM, gerbers and design files for the provolone add-on board to the XK-1.

- provolone_sw - contains the software for the provolone add-on board to the XK-1.

- xa-usba-led_hw - contains the schematic, BOM, gerbers and design files for the xa-usba-led add-on board to the XR-USB-AUDIO-2.0-MC.

- xa-usba-led_sw - contains the software for the xa-usba-led add-on board to the XR-USB-AUDIO-2.0-MC.
